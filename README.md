Node.js site Guestbook –application (6 p.)
Create a Guestbook app which will allow users to add messages to a public guestbook
page. Messages will be saved to a JSON file. Use Bootstrap of Pure.css to add styling.

1. Create a web server with Node.js and Express. Add four routes to your application: “/”,
   “/guestbook”, “newmessage” and “/ajaxmessage”.
2. / –route should display the frontpage of the site. You can make up this content yourself, it can
   be a Company / greetings page etc. The page should have navigation links which lead to other
   routes in the app. Below is a sample page.
3. /guestbook –route should load a JSON-file and parse it nicely on the page as a formatted table
   (use either Bootstrap or Pure.css to beautify the table). The demo JSON file is available here;
   http://pastebin.com/VpbJqSic.
4. /newmessage –route should add an input form to the page. Form should have fields for the
   following data: username, country and message and a button which enables user to send it.
   Don’t allow empty fields to be submitted.

5. When the form is submitted, the collected data should be saved as JSON data to the data file.
   Sample dataset can be seen below:
   Use JavaScripts Date() –function to store the timestamp of the submission. Id is not necessary
   in our app, but if you wish, you can create one for each item as well.
6. /ajaxmessage should display similar form to the user. The only difference is, that the Submit-
   button does not post the form, but rather it runs a Javascript-code on page which will collect
   the data from the text fields and send them to the backend as AJAX-call. It will also return all
   the messages as a response to the page, under the form.
   You can use native Javascript or jQuery to implement the code.
7. Publish the application in your GitHub repository. Deploy to Heroku. Return links to both
   Heroku app and GitHub-repo
